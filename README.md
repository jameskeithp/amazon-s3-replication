Replicate Data within and between AWS Regions Using Amazon S3 Replication
Overview

Amazon S3 Replication is an elastic, fully managed, low-cost feature that enables the replication of objects between Amazon S3 buckets. S3 Replication allows you to replicate data from one source bucket to multiple destination buckets, whether they are in the same AWS Region or different regions. This feature is useful for various purposes, such as maintaining secondary copies of data for data protection, complying with data sovereignty laws, reducing latency by having data in multiple geographies, enhancing disaster recovery capabilities, and optimizing regional efficiency.

This README.md provides a step-by-step guide to replicate data within and between AWS Regions using Amazon S3 Replication. It covers creating S3 buckets, configuring S3 Replication rules, choosing destination S3 buckets, setting up IAM roles, specifying encryption options, selecting S3 storage classes, and enabling additional replication options.
What you will accomplish

In this tutorial, you will:

    Create an S3 bucket
    Create an S3 Replication rule on your S3 bucket
    Choose a destination S3 bucket
    Choose or create IAM roles for replication
    Specify encryption type (optional)
    Choose a destination S3 storage class
    Enable additional replication options (optional)

Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

    An AWS account. If you don't have one, visit the AWS website to create and activate a new AWS account. Keep in mind that accounts created within the past 24 hours might not have access to the services required for this tutorial.
    Some basic familiarity with AWS services (Beginner level).
    Approximately 20 minutes of time.

Implementation
Step 1: Create an Amazon S3 bucket

1.1 Sign in to the Amazon S3 console:

    If you do not have an AWS account, create one.
    Log in to the AWS Management Console using your account information.
    From the AWS console services search bar, enter "S3." Under the services search results section, select "S3."

1.2 Create an S3 bucket:

    Choose "Buckets" from the Amazon S3 menu in the left navigation pane, then click the "Create bucket" button.

1.3 Enter bucket details:

    Provide a descriptive, globally unique name for your bucket.
    Select the AWS Region where you want your bucket created.
    Enable Bucket Versioning for both the source and destination S3 buckets (required for S3 Replication).
    Leave the remaining options as defaults and choose "Create bucket."

1.4 Repeat the above steps to create another S3 bucket to serve as the destination bucket for replicating objects. Ensure to enable Bucket Versioning for the destination bucket as well.
Step 2: Create an S3 Replication rule on your S3 bucket

2.1 Select the source S3 bucket:

    From your list of S3 buckets, choose the S3 bucket that you want to configure as the source for replication.

2.2 Review the S3 bucket landing page:

    The console will take you to the S3 bucket landing page, where you can review Objects, Properties, Permissions, Metrics, Management, and Access Points for the selected S3 bucket.

2.3 Create an S3 Replication rule:

    Choose the "Management" tab of the replication source bucket.
    Under Management, locate "Replication rules" and select "Create replication rule."

Step 3: Configure a replication rule

3.1 Enable the replication rule:

    Provide a Replication rule name and select "Enabled" under the Status section. A disabled replication rule will not run.
    Specify the priority for the rule (lower number indicates higher priority). Priority comes into play when two or more replication rules conflict. Replication occurs according to the rule with the highest priority.

3.2 Choose what to replicate:

    Narrow the scope of replication by defining a Filter type (Prefix or Tags) or choose to replicate the entire bucket.

3.3 Choose the destination S3 bucket:

    Select the destination bucket by clicking the "Browse S3" button. It can be in the same or a different AWS Region and account as the source bucket.

3.4 IAM considerations:

    Ensure that the IAM role associated with this configuration has sufficient permissions to write new objects in the destination bucket.
    You can choose to create a new IAM role or select an existing one with the appropriate permissions.

3.5 Encryption options (optional):

    If objects are encrypted with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) or AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), specify the encryption options while setting up replication.
    S3 Replication supports SSE-S3 and AWS KMS server-side encryption. For AWS KMS encryption, provide the AWS KMS keys for decryption and re-encryption in the destination.

3.6 Select the S3 storage class for your destination:

    Choose a different S3 storage class for your replicated objects at the destination bucket, based on your workloads and access patterns.

3.7 Additional replication options (optional):

    Choose additional replication options such as enabling S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC), Replication metrics and notifications, Delete marker replication, and Replica modifications sync.
    S3 RTC provides an SLA of 15 minutes to replicate 99.99% of your objects. You can enable RTC along with S3 Cross-Region Replication (S3 CRR) and S3 Same-Region Replication (S3 SRR).
    Review the replication configuration and choose "Save."

Step 4: Create another S3 Replication rule on the same source S3 bucket to another destination S3 bucket

    Repeat the previous steps to create another S3 Replication rule from the same source S3 bucket to another destination S3 bucket.
    Provide a Replication rule name and enable the replication rule.
    Choose what to replicate by defining the scope of the replication rule.
    Select the destination bucket by clicking the "Browse S3" button.
    Choose the Destination S3 storage class.
    Choose Additional replication options for the replication rule.

Step 5: Review replication configuration

    Once you save the replication rule, you can review the replication configuration with all the different replication rules, their priorities, and additional options.

Step 6: Monitor replication progress

6.1 Track per-destination metrics and notifications:

    Open the Metrics tab for the source bucket to view Replication metrics.
    Choose one or more Replication rules to monitor and display charts showing Operations pending replication, Bytes pending replication, and Replication latency.

6.2 View Replication metrics in CloudWatch (optional):

    Use the "View in CloudWatch" link to access Replication metrics on Amazon CloudWatch.
    In CloudWatch, you can get a comprehensive view of the replication metrics for each replication rule, source bucket, and destination bucket in one place.

Step 7: Monitor replication status for individual objects

    Use Amazon S3 Inventory to audit and report on the replication status of your objects.
    The replication status of a source object can be Pending, Completed, or Failed.
    The replication status of a replica will return "Replica."

Step 8: Clean up resources

8.1 Delete test object:

    Navigate to the S3 console and select the bucket you have been working with for this tutorial.
    Delete the test object from the bucket.

8.2 Delete test buckets:

    Return to the list of buckets in your account.
    Select the radio button to the left of the source bucket and choose the "Delete" button.
    Repeat the previous step to delete the destination bucket.

Conclusion

Congratulations! You have learned how to use S3 Replication to replicate objects from source to destination S3 buckets across one or many AWS Regions. This feature allows you to meet compliance requirements, minimize latency, and increase operational efficiency.

I recommend enabling metrics and notifications for each replication rule, turning on Amazon S3 Event Notifications on your source bucket, and setting up appropriate Amazon CloudWatch metrics and alerts. This way, you can track the progress of S3 Replication to one or more S3 buckets. S3 Replication is a fully managed, low-cost, and policy-based storage management feature that requires little to no manual intervention.
